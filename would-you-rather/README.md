Project: Woul you rather...
Author: Alejandro Regueira

## Projecct Overview
In the "Would You Rather?" Project, I'll build a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

In this app, users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

## Data:

There are two types of objects stored in our database:

    Users
    Questions

User's include:
ATTRIBUTE    TYPE         DESCRIPTION
id           string       The user’s unique identifier
name         string       The user’s first name and last name
avatarURL    string       The path to the image file
questions    array        A list of ids of the polling questions this user created
answers      object       The object's keys are the ids of each question this user answered.   
                          The value of each key is the answer the user selected. It can be
                          'optionOne' or 'optionTwo' since each question has two options.

Question's include:
ATTRIBUTE   TYPE          DESCRIPTION
id          string        The question’s unique identifier
author      string        The author’s unique identifier
timestamp   string        The time when the question was created
optionOne   object        The first voting option
optionTwo   object        The second voting option

## installing
To run the project:
1) npm install
2) npm start

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
